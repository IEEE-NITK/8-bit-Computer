# 8-bit-Computer
Our aim is to design a 8 bit breadboard computer using hardware components.
We will be following SAP-1 architecture for building our computer. This computer will be executing different types of instructions. We will be implementing various modules like ALU, Clock module, Registers, RAM module, Program Counter etc. PCB of the computer shall also be designed.

## Objective
* Understanding basics of computer architecture and organization
* Understanding various types of architectures used to build a computer
* Hands-on experience in building a computer
* Get an experience to design a PCB on EasyEDA
## Modules
### Clock module
The computer’s clock is used to synchronize all operations. The clock is built using the 555 timer IC.
It consists of an astable 555 timer, a monostable 555 timer and a bistable 555 timer.
We can output either the oscillating pulse(generated by the astable timer) or the manual pulse(generated by the monostable timer) depending on the select line( that is, the value generated by the bistable timer). If select is 1, then the oscillating pulse is given as the output otherwise the manual pulse is the output.

### Registers
The registers in a computer are data storage elements used by the CPU. Registers store small amounts of data that the CPU is processing. It usually holds the operands or the instructions that the CPU is currently processing. The 8 bit computer has 3 registers: register A register B and instruction register (IR). Registers A and B are general purpose registers used to store operands (data) or memory pointers (addresses). 

#### Register A and Register B
The A and B registers are composed of two 4 bit data registers namely 74LS173 and one 74LS245 octal bus. The two 4 bit data registers are driven by the clock module and each receive 4 data bits. The data can be transferred to the octal bus or just stored in the register based on the control pins 1 and 2 (Oe1 and Oe2, which is zero/grounded in our case). The pins 8 and 9 are load pins which are used to control loading of data from input pins to the register, when the load pin is low it loads data into the register and doesn't load when it is high. The output pins of the register are connected to LED’s to show the data stored in it and also connected to the octal bus. The bus has a direction input pin to control the direction of data flow (high, input to output pin flow in our case) and it has an enable pin which transfers data from register to bus when low and  doesn’t transfer when high.

#### Instruction Register
The instruction register (IR)is very similar to the A and B registers with few differences in working and usage. The IR stores the address of the instructions in 4 bits. The 4 bits are the last four least significant bits (LSB) of the IR. These bits indicate the instruction to be executed and can be loaded to the bus using the enable pin. The remaining 4 bits which are the most significant bits (MSB) of the IR are sent to the instruction decoder.
