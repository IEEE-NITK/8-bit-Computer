### Clock module
The computerâ€™s clock is used to synchronize all operations. The clock is built using the 555 timer IC.
It consists of an astable 555 timer, a monostable 555 timer and a bistable 555 timer.
We can output either the oscillating pulse(generated by the astable timer) or the manual pulse(generated by the monostable timer) depending on the select line( that is, the value generated by the bistable timer). If select is 1, then the oscillating pulse is given as the output otherwise the manual pulse is the output.
